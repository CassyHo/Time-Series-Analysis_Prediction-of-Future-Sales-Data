# Time-Series-Analysis_Prediction-of-Future-Sales-Data

## Abstract
In this project, I try to use three different time series data: sales of Retail Trade and Food Services, sales of Manufactureâ€™s shipment, inventory and orders, and sales of Motor Vehicle or Auto parts to predict the future trends of these three series. I came up with an ARIMA model for each series, and then I combined the three series with a multivariate autoregressive model. The results showed that those three series can significantly predict each other.

## Introduction
Gross Domestic Product(GDP) is the total value of final goods and services produced within a country over a period of time. The manufacture data can be a valuable indicator for the macroeconomic market. The sales of retail trade and food services can represent the personal consumption which plays a significant role in the health of economy. For instance, if the retail and food services growth is slowing or stalled, this indicates that consumers are not spending at previous levels. In addition, the sales of motor vehicle or auto parts can also be representative of the personal consumption. Thus, I choose to analyze these series from 2000 to 2018. One is sales of Retail Trade and Food Services, another is monthly sales of Manufacturer's Shipment, Inventory and Orders, the other is sales of Motor Vehicle or Auto parts. The monetary unit of the three series are in millions of US dollars.
